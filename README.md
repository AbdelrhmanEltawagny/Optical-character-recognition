# Optical-character-recognition
In this project, we extract text from images using openCV library and pytesseract library, and then we read this text using gTTS library.

# libraries :

- cv2 : to read the image.

- gTTS (Google-Text-To-Speech) : is a Python library. it's a very easy to use it which converts the text entered, into audio which can be saved as a mp3 file. You can install it from this link : https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/

- playsound : The playsound module is a cross platform module that can play audio files. You can install it from this link : https://pypi.org/project/playsound/

- pytesseract : Tesseract is an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine. It can read and recognize text in images and is commonly used in python ocr image to text use cases.You can install it from this link : https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/

Note :

During the installation of this library, we are not only satisfied with writing pip install pytesseract but we also need to download an extension to this library and install it on the device in order to this library works without errors. we can download this extension from this link : https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.2.0.20220712.exe
